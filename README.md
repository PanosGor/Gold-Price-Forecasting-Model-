# Gold-Price-Forecasting-Model-
Gold prediction model in R

## Data Preprocessing

- Identify missing values-Days and Prices missing from original database file
- Create an average price per week table to fill the missing values
- Plot the data after the preprocessing
- Very interesting the spike happening around 2011, which resulted to higher prices up until 2018
- Also plotted the average price per day to analyze the patterns and differences between days
- As it is shown there are no significant differences between days, which results to no pattern identified
- Last step was to prepare an average price per month and year table for the forecasting part
